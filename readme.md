## Project Description  
Plastic pollution is a major global concern, and effective waste segregation is essential in addressing this issue. This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plastic waste into distinct categories, enabling automated waste management and contributing to more efficient recycling and segregation processes.

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is the Waste Classification Data by Sashaank Sekar, comprising 25,077 labeled images split into two categories: Organic and Recyclable. It is specifically designed to aid in waste classification tasks using machine learning techniques.

### Key Details:
- **Total Images**: 25,077  
  - **Training Data**: 22,564 images (85%)  
  - **Test Data**: 2,513 images (15%)  
- **Classes**: Organic and Recyclable  
- **Purpose**: To aid in automating waste management and reducing the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.
  
### Approach:  
- Researched waste management strategies and reviewed relevant white papers.
- Analyzed the composition of household waste.
- Segregated waste into two categories: Organic and Recyclable.
- Utilized IoT and machine learning technologies to automate the waste classification process.
